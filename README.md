WebsocketServer is a simple app created in React and Electron. It allows to easily create websocket server and send a message. You can use it during development for a quick test of your frontend code which uses websockets.

## Usage

For now, the only way to use this app is to clone this repo and run the app in development mode. In near future executables, files will be added for all available operating systems.

```
git clone https://github.com/Feridum/websocket-server
cd <folder name>
yarn
yarn react
yarn electron
```

Soon, will be added a single command to run both commands
